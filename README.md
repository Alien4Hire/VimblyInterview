List of incomplete: 

    I was unable to complete any styling or submitting for this form. I ran into a time constraint issue that I believe was caused by poor planning of the app on my part. 

    There is some validation of the form such as if you press submit and the email field is not correctly filled it will alert you to the fact.

    I was working on the select box for the support at the time the project ended and was unable to debug/test that it was going to work. I ended up deleting some of the work I had done so the code would run correctly since the test was over.

If I had more time:

    If I had more time to do this project right I would have done more planning in the beginning phase of the project. I ended up jumping around from task to task and changing what/ how I was going to complete the project multiple times which cost me valuable time.  

known issues:

I did not use a css library or have much time to write css for the form. If you are using internet explorer to visit this form some of the styling will not render correctly.
